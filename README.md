# Performance Reporting with Twitter Analytics data

Today, we'll be using Python to chart Twitter performance metrics based on the standard set of data provided by Twitter Analytics. By the end of this project, we will be able to vizualize or list the following pieces of information:

- Display the user's most active windows on Twitter.
- Show the user's most mentioned accounts and hashtags.
- Calculate Twitter engagement totals and averages per tweet
- Uncover the optimal time windows for the best engagement performance.
- Understand the themes of the user's most popular content.
